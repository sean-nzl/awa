# Upgrade Checklist: 0.5.x → 0.6

> **Planning to run 0.7?** Finalize before upgrading: the 0.7 `awa migrate` refuses unfinalized clusters ([ADR-037](../adr/037-canonical-engine-deprecation/index.md), [Upgrade 0.6 to 0.7](../upgrade-0.6-to-0.7/index.md)).

This is the operator-facing source of truth for moving an existing 0.5.x cluster to 0.6 (queue-storage-by-default). It defines the pre-flight, rollout phases, rollback boundary, and health checks; [Migrations](../migrations/index.md) covers the general migration contract and external tooling.

> **Fresh installs do not need this file.** A new cluster runs `awa migrate` and starts workers; the first worker auto-finalizes via `awa.storage_auto_finalize_if_fresh()`. See migrations.md ["Fresh install"](../migrations/index.md#fresh-install-no-prior-canonical-data). This checklist is for **upgrading existing 0.5.x clusters**, where canonical drain is unavoidable and auto-finalize correctly defers to the staged path.

## Pre-flight

- [ ] Cluster is on `0.5.latest` everywhere (no mixed older versions)
- [ ] `awa storage status` shows `state=canonical / current=canonical / active=canonical / prepared=NULL`
- [ ] Schema is at the latest 0.5.x migration: `SELECT MAX(version) FROM awa.schema_version`
- [ ] Backups taken (or backup tooling verified) — there's no `awa migrate` downgrade path
- [ ] Operator has access to:
  - Run `awa storage` commands against the production DSN
  - Inspect `awa.runtime_instances` for live capability reporting
  - Watch worker logs / Grafana dashboards during the cutover
- [ ] Confirmed every queue-storage-capable Python worker is on an `awa-pg` wheel that exposes the ADR-023 claim-ring knobs (the `queue_storage_claim_*` kwargs on `client.start()`); skip if running Rust-only

## Phase 1 — last 0.5.x everywhere (safe stop)

```bash
# 1. Apply the prep migration
awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" migrate

# 2. Verify cluster is still fully canonical
awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" storage status

# 3. Confirm runtime capability is canonical-only
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
  SELECT instance_id, storage_capability, last_seen_at
  FROM awa.runtime_instances
  ORDER BY last_seen_at DESC;
"
```

**Expected:** `current_engine=canonical`, `active_engine=canonical`, `prepared_engine=NULL`, `state=canonical`. Every live `runtime_instance` reports `storage_capability=canonical` (not `queue_storage`).

This is a **safe stopping point**. The queue is fully canonical and behavior is unchanged. You can sit here indefinitely.

## Rollback boundaries

Read this before starting Phase 2. The rollout has one explicit one-way door — knowing exactly where it sits is the difference between "abort" and "restore from backup":

- **canonical → prepared**: `awa storage abort` returns to canonical. Trivial.
- **prepared → canonical**: `awa storage abort` clears the prepared engine metadata. Trivial.
- **mixed_transition (no queue-storage work yet)**: `awa storage abort` rolls back. The interlock requires no live queue-storage runtimes AND no rows in queue-storage tables. Acceptable while the routing flip just happened and producers haven't enqueued yet.
- **mixed_transition (queue-storage rows exist) — ONE-WAY**: `awa storage abort` is rejected. From this point onward you must either finish the transition (`finalize`) or restore from backup. A pure fleet downgrade to 0.5 is **not supported** because 0.5 workers don't know how to claim queue-storage work.
- **active → anything**: not supported by `awa storage abort`. Use database restore.

The `/api/storage` dashboard card shows the current transition state, backlog, schema readiness, and rollback boundary.

## Phase 2 — 0.6 rollout

> **Crossing the line below is a one-way door once any queue-storage work has been accepted.** Re-read [Rollback boundaries](#rollback-boundaries) above before kicking off Phase 2.

```bash
# 1. Roll out 0.6 binaries (rolling deploy). 0.5.x and 0.6 pods may
#    coexist; while state is still canonical or prepared, all writes
#    and execution stay canonical.

# 2. Optional: materialize a custom queue-storage schema before the
#    routing flip. The default `awa` schema is already materialized by
#    `awa migrate`; run this only if you want an isolated schema name or
#    non-default slot counts, and pass the same schema in step 3's --details.
# awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" storage prepare-queue-storage-schema --schema <custom_schema>

# 3. Record the prepared engine. Default schema is `awa`; pass
#    --details '{"schema":"<name>"}' to record a different name.
awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" storage prepare --engine queue_storage

# 4. Verify prepared state.
awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" storage status
#    → current=canonical, active=canonical, prepared=queue_storage, state=prepared

# 5. Confirm every live runtime is queue-storage capable BEFORE the
#    flip. This is the operator-side pre-flight that prevents
#    canonical-only (0.5) workers from surviving into mixed_transition.
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
  SELECT count(*) FILTER (WHERE storage_capability != 'queue_storage') AS canonical_only
  FROM awa.runtime_instances
  WHERE last_seen_at > now() - interval '90 seconds';
"
#    → canonical_only must be 0

# 6. Start at least one runtime with `transition_role=queue_storage_target`.
#    This is what the mixed-transition SQL gate actually requires. An auto-role
#    runtime started before mixed_transition resolves its effective
#    storage to canonical at startup and will downgrade to
#    `canonical_drain_only` immediately after routing flips, leaving
#    the cluster with no queue-storage executor. A queue-storage target
#    is the witness that someone will keep executing queue-storage work
#    once routing flips.
#
#    In Rust:
#      Client::builder(pool)
#          .queue_storage(...)
#          .transition_role(TransitionWorkerRole::QueueStorageTarget)
#
#    In Python:
#      client.start([(queue, n)],
#                   queue_storage_schema=schema,
#                   storage_transition_role="queue_storage_target")
#
#    Verify it has registered:
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
  SELECT count(*) AS live_targets
  FROM awa.runtime_instances
  WHERE transition_role = 'queue_storage_target'
    AND storage_capability = 'queue_storage'
    AND last_seen_at > now() - interval '90 seconds';
"
#    → live_targets must be ≥ 1

# 7. Flip routing. New writes and cron enqueues go to queue storage.
awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" storage enter-mixed-transition

# 8. Finalize. `--wait` polls every 5s and invokes the SQL finalize after
#    canonical_live_backlog is empty for two consecutive observations.
#    Pre-flip auto runtimes remain canonical_drain_only and idle; v040 no
#    longer requires them to restart or age out before finalization. Roll
#    them normally afterward; replacements resolve directly to queue storage.
#    Default wait is unbounded; pass e.g. `--wait=2h` to cap. Progress is
#    emitted via structured `tracing` logs (set `RUST_LOG=info` to see it).
awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" storage finalize --wait
#    → exits 0 once state=active; exits 2 if the wait cap expires
#       while blockers remain.

# 8a. (Optional) Dry-run the readiness gates first without changing
#     state. `--check` prints the same JSON `awa storage status`
#     would, plus a one-line summary, and exits 2 if blocked.
awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" storage finalize --check

# 9. Verify active state.
awa --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" storage status
#    → current=queue_storage, active=queue_storage, prepared=NULL, state=active

# 10. Once state=active, the queue-storage-target runtime is no longer
#     special — auto-role runtimes started from now on resolve to queue
#     storage at startup. Either keep the explicit target running or
#     redeploy it without --transition-role; behavior is identical
#     post-flip.
```

## Quiesced alternative to the witness runtime

A CLI carrying [#457](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/457) accepts
`awa storage enter-mixed-transition --quiesced` after `storage prepare`.
This path runs without a schema migration and replaces Phase 2 steps 6–7.
It is intended for a stopped fleet, not a live rollout:

1. Stop producers and drain canonical work before stopping workers if you want
   a fully role-free cutover. Inspect `canonical_live_backlog`, including scheduled
   work and jobs waiting for external callbacks.
2. Stop every worker and keep them stopped. Wait for runtime heartbeats to expire
   (at least 30 seconds, or three snapshot intervals when longer). The command
   refuses **any** fresh runtime, including unhealthy or shutting-down ones.
3. Run `awa storage enter-mixed-transition --quiesced`. The liveness check and
   routing change serialize against runtime snapshot writes. Stale heartbeats
   do not fence a paused process; preventing old workers from returning during
   this window remains an operator responsibility.
4. Run `awa storage finalize --check`, then `awa storage finalize` when ready.
   Restart workers on 0.6 and resume producers; new auto-role workers resolve
   queue storage at startup.

The command preserves canonical jobs and does not bypass finalization gates.
If canonical backlog remains, drain it with canonical drain workers before
finalizing; restarting only auto-role workers after the flip will not execute
canonical work. Use the live staged path above when a stop-and-drain window
is impractical.

Callback APIs carrying [#462](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/462) resolve
callbacks left on canonical jobs throughout `mixed_transition`, including
completion, resume, failure, retry, heartbeat and CEL resolution. Lease checks
and transaction rollback still apply. Run a 0.6 backport containing this fix
before flipping a cluster with outstanding callbacks; a fix installed only in
0.7 arrives too late for an unfinalized cluster.

## Health checks per step

| After step | Watch for |
| --- | --- |
| migrate | `SELECT MAX(version) FROM awa.schema_version` advances; `awa storage status` reports no schema-readiness blocker |
| prepare custom queue-storage schema | `SELECT to_regclass('<custom_schema>.ready_entries')` returns non-NULL (the substrate exists — `awa storage status` cannot verify a custom schema until the later `storage prepare` records it) |
| prepare | `awa storage status` reports `state=prepared` |
| start queue-storage target | `awa.runtime_instances` shows `transition_role='queue_storage_target'` and `storage_capability='queue_storage'` for the new instance; `awa storage status` lists no `enter_mixed_transition_blockers` |
| enter-mixed-transition | `awa_maintenance_rotate_attempts_total{awa_ring="queue", awa_ring_outcome="rotated"}` is non-zero in Grafana; queue ring `current_slot` advancing |
| watch canonical drain | `awa_storage_canonical_live_backlog` trending to 0 (it counts non-terminal `jobs_hot` **plus every** `scheduled_jobs` row); `awa_queue_depth{awa_job_state="available"}` on the canonical side falling alongside it |
| finalize | `awa storage status` reports `state=active`; live `canonical_drain_only` runtimes are idle and may be rolled normally |

## Watch list during the rollout

These are the metrics that distinguish "transition healthy" from "transition stuck", available on the OTel Prometheus dashboard (panel row "Ring rotation & prune (queue-storage)"):

- `awa_maintenance_rotate_attempts_total{awa_ring="queue", awa_ring_outcome="rotated"}` should advance steadily — this is the headline "ring is rotating" signal
- `awa_maintenance_rotate_attempts_total{awa_ring_outcome="skipped_busy"}` rate should stay flat — sustained `skipped_busy` traffic with `awa_ring_blocker="queue.ready_rows"` means producers are outpacing consumers
- `awa_queue_lag_seconds` p95 should not climb past your latency SLO
- `awa_maintenance_prune_attempts_total{awa_ring_outcome="blocked"}` rate should be near zero — non-zero `blocked` means a held-tx is preventing partition reclaim
- `awa_storage_canonical_live_backlog` should trend monotonically to 0 once routing has flipped — a backlog that plateaus while jobs are visibly executing means canonical work is being re-created rather than drained, which is the shape [#456](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/456) fixed (see Known issues)

If any of these go wrong **before** any queue-storage work is accepted, `awa storage abort` is still available. After, you commit to forward-only.

## Known issues

- **Python workers without claim-ring knobs.** Older Python wheels don't accept `queue_storage_claim_slot_count` / `queue_storage_claim_rotate_interval_ms` on `client.start()`. They'll still run with default values and the rollout will work, but operators wanting non-default ring sizing need a wheel that exposes those kwargs.
- **Held-tx during finalize.** A long-running canonical transaction (e.g., reporting query) blocks vacuum, which can stall partition prune in the queue-storage tables. `awa_maintenance_prune_attempts_total{awa_ring_outcome="blocked"}` will rise. Identify and terminate the held-tx; prune resumes on the next maintenance tick.
- **Perpetually snoozing jobs stall the drain on older builds.** A handler that ends every run in `JobResult::Snooze` (recurring per-entity polls, heartbeat-style jobs) used to re-enter *canonical* `scheduled_jobs` after each post-flip execution, so `canonical_live_backlog` replenished itself and `awa storage finalize --wait` blocked indefinitely. Fixed in [#456](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/456): once routing has flipped, each re-schedule leaves the canonical plane. It ordinarily lands in the prepared schema's `deferred_jobs`; if a newer duplicate owns a claim required by the destination state, the old attempt becomes cancelled terminal evidence and never becomes executable. Upgrade to a build carrying the fix. There is no safe online manual move on an older build: deleting `awa.job_unique_claims` separately opens the key to concurrent producers. If an emergency manual move is unavoidable, first stop every producer and worker that can touch the database, keep them stopped for the entire delete-and-reinsert operation, and preserve the full payload and uniqueness metadata when reinserting through `awa.insert_job_compat(...)`. A plain `INSERT` into the `awa.jobs` compatibility view does **not** route; it is canonical-only.
- **0.6 rollback after queue-storage work.** Not supported via `awa storage abort` once any rows exist in queue-storage tables. Plan accordingly: keep `0.6` workers available throughout the transition window. Only emergency rollback path is database restore.
