# ADR-041: Rolling upgrade policy

## Status

Accepted. The [migration-authoring checklist](../../development/index.md#authoring-schema-migrations) and automated mixed-version rehearsal tracked by [#427](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/427) carry this decision into practice.

## Context

Awa is infrastructure in the request path of other systems. Its normal release process therefore needs to support incremental fleet replacement while work continues. Migration order is not reliably controlled across all deployments: an operator may migrate before rolling workers, roll workers before migrating, or have both actions overlap.

The 0.6 to 0.7 work exposed three independent failure classes:

1. A pre-guard 0.6 binary could mistake a newer schema for a legacy schema, rewrite `awa.schema_version`, and reapply old migrations. This was a destructive fail-open path, not a compatibility limitation ([#392](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/392)).
2. The first v042 design removed columns still used by 0.6 binaries. That made migration order part of the correctness contract and prevented a mixed fleet.
3. An authority flip introduces a different boundary from schema expansion. Even if old and new binaries can share the expanded schema, a returning old binary must not write the retired representation after the flip.

The 2026-07-12 production-style rehearsal established useful baseline evidence: transactional migration under load, hard-kill recovery, scheduled work, and exact reconciliation across 50,772 jobs. It did **not** run old and new workers concurrently. It is therefore evidence for migration and recovery behavior, not proof of the mixed-version contract defined here.

v042 was redesigned around an additive schema, explicit authority, and a runtime flip. It is the first application of this policy, but not a claim that every policy requirement was already met. In particular, during a migrate-first interval with only 0.6.2 workers, crash and heartbeat rescue remain available, but deadline rescue for newly written compact claim batches resumes only when a 0.7 runtime takes maintenance leadership — starting a 0.7 worker is not sufficient while a 0.6 runtime remains leader. That transitional limitation is documented in the 0.7 upgrade guide and is covered by the rehearsal in #427 (the compact deadline-rescue handoff cell). Future changes must either preserve maintenance semantics in N-1 or document and approve an explicit policy exception before release.

## Decision

### 1. Rolling is the default release contract

Schema and representation changes are designed for a rolling deployment. A change that cannot support one uses the exception process in Decision 8; it is not described as rolling merely because failures are loud.

For a release N expand migration, these orderings must be supported:

- N-1 binaries operating the N schema before the fleet flip;
- N binaries operating the N-1 schema while migration is pending;
- N-1 and N binaries operating concurrently during the rollout; and
- migration running before, during, or after binary replacement.

"Operating" means preserving job lifecycle and maintenance semantics, not only starting successfully. Claim, complete, retry, cancel, scheduled and cron work, heartbeat recovery, deadline recovery, pruning, and operator counts are all in scope when the changed representation affects them.

### 2. Representation changes use expand, flip, and contract

The phases are separate release actions:

- **Expand:** Add the new representation and its compatibility machinery. Keep the old representation authoritative for an upgraded database. Seed the new representation from the old one. Fresh installs may start on the new representation because no earlier binary can have observed that database.
- **Flip:** After the fleet proves capability, reconcile the new representation from the old authoritative state, verify equivalence, atomically change authority, and install the old-binary fence.
- **Contract:** Remove the retired representation in a later minor release, no earlier than the release after the flip is universal. The contract migration has its own N-1 analysis; it is not automatically entitled to an exclusive window.

Migration does not perform an irreversible runtime flip. Schema version proves which SQL committed, not which binaries are live.

### 3. Expand migrations may declare a runtime version floor

Sometimes compatibility with the expanded schema first ships in an N-1 patch. The preferred preflight is then a minimum runtime version, not a refusal of all live runtimes.

`MIGRATION_RUNTIME_VERSION_FLOORS` maps a migration to the oldest verified runtime version. Before applying that migration, the built-in migrator:

- considers only fresh heartbeats;
- treats older, missing, or unparseable versions as below the floor;
- names incompatible instances in the refusal;
- holds a table lock that prevents runtime registration or heartbeat writes between the check and migration commit; and
- allows an explicit `--allow-live-runtimes` override.

Because runtime registration and observability snapshots write `runtime_instances`, the table lock briefly stalls fleet-wide observability heartbeats for the duration of the migration transaction. It does not block job or lease heartbeats. Migration authors must account for that snapshot gap when estimating the impact of a long-running expand migration.

This gate uses `runtime_instances.version`. That value is acceptable here as a defense-in-depth check over a documented patch prerequisite: the migration is still additive, and the operator can override the check after independent verification. It is not sufficient evidence for an irreversible flip.

External migration systems do not execute the Rust preflight. Their release procedure must enforce the same version floor and race boundary, or enforce the documented ordering by other means.

### 4. Flips use capability evidence

An irreversible flip requires evidence written by binaries that contain the new behavior. The current pattern is:

- `runtime_instances.binary_version`, introduced with the capability-aware schema;
- `awa.semver_rank()` with fail-closed parsing; and
- a per-feature minimum version function such as `awa.ring_authority_min_flip_version()`.

The per-feature minimum is schema-owned: the expand migration installs the SQL constant, and the feature's migration owner changes it through a later schema migration when a newer binary floor is required. Binaries query the constant; they do not compile their own copy. This keeps flip readiness consistent across all capability-aware binaries connected to the database.

A fresh heartbeat with a NULL, unparseable, or below-minimum capability value blocks the flip. A stability interval before auto-flip reduces the chance that a temporarily absent old process is mistaken for a completed rollout. Manual override is explicit and separate from the migration override.

### 5. The old representation is authoritative until flip

Compatibility shadow writes are not sufficient at the flip boundary. Under a mixed fleet, the final writer may be an N-1 process that updates only the old representation.

The flip must therefore:

1. take the same locks used by old-representation writers;
2. read authority only after those locks are held;
3. treat the old representation as source of truth;
4. reconcile the complete new representation through that final state;
5. verify exact equivalence; and
6. change authority and install the fence in the same transaction.

For v042, the locked `current_slot` and `generation` columns are the source of truth. `awa.flip_ring_authority()` backfills every missing ledger generation and verifies the ledger cursor before promoting it. This closes both the final old-writer race and the authority-read TOCTOU found by the lock-order model.

### 6. A flip includes a database-enforced fence

After flip, a returning pre-flip binary must fail before it can misroute or prune work. Application logging alone is not a fence.

The fence must cover the actual old write paths and be verified with the real N-1 artifact. For v042, setting only `current_slot = -1` was insufficient: an old rotator could compute `-1 -> 0`. The implemented fence poisons both cursor fields and legacy prune metadata, then uses a database trigger to reject an old-style cursor advance after ledger authority is active.

Rollback to N-1 is supported before flip. After flip, pre-flip binaries are deliberately rejected; rollback remains within flip-aware releases.

### 7. Version and migration handling fail closed

- A binary that observes `MAX(schema_version) > CURRENT_VERSION` refuses before legacy detection, normalization, or any schema write.
- Unknown capability and version values do not satisfy gates.
- Built-in migrations are serialized and transactional, so other sessions see the schema before or after the migration set, not an intermediate committed version. External runners that commit each version separately must account for intermediate-version refusal.
- Overrides are named operator actions and are never defaults.

### 8. Exclusive migrations are an exception

`EXCLUSIVE_WINDOW_MIGRATIONS` remains available for a migration with no practical rolling-compatible shape. Adding an entry requires:

- an ADR or equivalent design review explaining why expand/flip/contract and a runtime version floor are insufficient;
- justification in the migration header;
- a CHANGELOG callout and release-specific operator procedure; and
- tests for refusal, override, and stale-heartbeat behavior.

A release should not contain an exclusive migration merely to simplify implementation. Contract migrations must first be evaluated against the normal N-1 contract and capability fences; they are not presumed exclusive.

### 9. Validation precedes release

Any migration that changes a hot-path structure or stored representation must pass a mixed-version rehearsal using released N-1 artifacts and the current build. At minimum it covers:

- live enqueue and a banked backlog throughout migration;
- N-1-only operation on the expanded schema;
- old and new workers claiming concurrently;
- failing and retrying jobs, scheduled jobs, and cron fires;
- in-flight jobs held across migration;
- hard kills with crash and heartbeat rescue asserted;
- deadline-overrun rescue when receipt representations change;
- migrate-first, binary-first, and overlapping orderings;
- the flip, old-binary fence, and supported rollback boundary; and
- exact reconciliation: every accepted job and scheduled fire accounted for once, with nothing stuck.

When a state machine or lock order changes, TLA+ models cover mixed-version interleavings. Tests must exercise real old artifacts because source-level compatibility helpers cannot prove frozen binary behavior.

Evidence is recorded with the release or in the benchmarking repository. #427 tracks automation of this matrix.

## Consequences

- Operators normally roll Awa minor releases without draining the whole fleet. An exceptional release may still require a documented exclusive procedure.
- Representation changes span at least two releases and carry compatibility code, dual representations, and fence state until contract.
- Rollback has a precise boundary: N-1 before flip, flip-aware binaries after flip.
- Migration authors must prove maintenance-path parity, not only foreground job operations.
- Releases pay for mixed-version tests and, where relevant, larger model state spaces.

## Alternatives considered

- **Always require an exclusive window for representation changes.** Simpler for implementation, but makes deployment ordering a correctness dependency and does not address fail-open old binaries.
- **Use schema version as flip evidence.** Rejected because migration and fleet replacement are independent events.
- **Use `runtime_instances.version` for flips.** Rejected as capability proof; retained only for overridable expand-migration floors.
- **Reuse storage transition enums.** Rejected because their meanings are tied to one state machine.
- **Leave mixed-version validation manual and informal.** Rejected because the 2026-07-12 rehearsal did not cover concurrent versions, exactly the behavior this policy needs to establish.

## Relationship to other ADRs

This ADR generalizes ADR-040's authority design, strengthens ADR-036's public binary/schema skew contract, and retains ADR-037's refusal-first migration discipline without reusing its transition-specific state. It constrains future storage ADRs and migration reviews.
