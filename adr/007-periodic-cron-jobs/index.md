# ADR-007: Periodic/Cron Jobs via Leader-Evaluated Schedules

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Every production job queue needs periodic/cron job support. Without it, users must wire up an external cron daemon (systemd timers, Kubernetes CronJobs, or crontab) to insert jobs on a schedule, which defeats Awa's "Postgres is the only dependency" pitch. Every competitor (River, Oban, GoodJob) ships cron scheduling as a core feature.

The question is: where do schedules live and who evaluates them?

Options considered:

1. **Application-side timers.** Each worker instance runs its own `tokio::time::interval` and inserts jobs when timers fire. Simple, but without coordination every instance would insert duplicates.

2. **Database-side `pg_cron` extension.** Schedules are defined as `pg_cron` jobs. Zero application code, but requires the `pg_cron` extension which isn't available on all managed Postgres services (RDS, Cloud SQL). Violates the "vanilla Postgres" constraint.

3. **`awa.cron_jobs` table + leader-evaluated schedules.** Schedules are defined in application code, synced to a database table by the leader, and evaluated on a timer within the existing `MaintenanceService`. When a schedule fires, the leader atomically marks it as enqueued AND inserts the job.

## Decision

Option 3: `awa.cron_jobs` table with leader-evaluated schedules.

Schedules are defined in Rust (`ClientBuilder::periodic()`) or Python (`client.periodic()`), validated eagerly at registration time (bad cron expressions or timezones fail at startup), and synced to `awa.cron_jobs` via UPSERT every 60 seconds. The leader evaluates all schedules every 1 second and enqueues jobs when they're due.

### Crash-safe atomic enqueue

The biggest risk in any cron scheduler is the "mark-then-insert" gap: if the process marks a schedule as fired, then crashes before inserting the job, the fire is lost. Awa solves this with a single CTE that atomically does both:

```sql
WITH mark AS (
    UPDATE awa.cron_jobs
    SET last_enqueued_at = $2, updated_at = now()
    WHERE name = $1
      AND (last_enqueued_at IS NOT DISTINCT FROM $3)
    RETURNING name, kind, queue, args, ...
)
INSERT INTO awa.jobs (kind, queue, args, state, ...)
SELECT kind, queue, args, 'available', ...
FROM mark
RETURNING *
```

The `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` clause acts as a compare-and-swap: if another leader already claimed this fire (last_enqueued_at changed), the UPDATE matches 0 rows and the INSERT produces nothing. If the process crashes mid-transaction, Postgres rolls back both. Either both happen or neither does.

### Multi-deployment safety

A naive sync would `DELETE FROM awa.cron_jobs WHERE name NOT IN (...)` to remove schedules that no longer exist in code. But when multiple deployments share the same database (e.g., a web service and a background worker), each deployment would delete the other's schedules.

Awa's sync is additive: UPSERT only, never DELETE. Stale schedules from decommissioned deployments can be cleaned up manually via `awa cron remove <name>` or direct SQL.

### Missed-fire policy

By default, when evaluation is delayed or a worker starts after being down, the scheduler enqueues only the most recent missed fire time per schedule, not every missed occurrence. This `coalesce` policy avoids a thundering herd of jobs when a worker recovers from a long outage.

Schedules that represent reconciliation or polling work can opt into `catch_up`, which enqueues each missed fire in timestamp order subject to the worker's bounded per-pass catch-up limit. Catch-up schedules should use idempotent handlers and expect several jobs to appear in quick succession after downtime.

### Pause and resume

Schedules can be paused without deleting them. `cron_jobs.paused_at` (a nullable timestamp) records when the schedule was paused; `paused_by` records the operator label. The column shape mirrors `queue_meta` so operators see one convention for both pause surfaces.

The evaluator skips paused rows up front to avoid wasted CAS work, and the `atomic_enqueue` CTE re-checks `paused_at IS NULL` inside the same UPDATE that performs the compare-and-swap on `last_enqueued_at`. The CTE guard is load-bearing: it closes the window where a leader read the schedule, the operator paused it, and the leader then attempted to enqueue.

`last_enqueued_at` is not touched while paused. On resume, the existing `missed_fire_policy` decides catch-up behaviour — a coalesced schedule fires once on resume; a catch-up schedule replays missed fires in order, bounded by the per-pass limit. Operators choose the catch-up shape when they register the schedule; pausing does not change it.

Manual triggers (`trigger_cron_job`) bypass pause. Pause stops _automatic_ fires; an explicit operator action is always allowed. Operators who want the schedule to be entirely inert should delete the row.

#### In-flight jobs and queue pause

Once `atomic_enqueue` commits, the job is a normal row in the queue with no back-reference to its cron source other than `metadata.cron_name` as a label. Pausing a schedule does not affect:

- jobs already sitting `available` in the queue (a worker will pick them up),
- jobs currently `running` (heartbeats, deadlines, and callbacks continue),
- subsequent retries of those jobs (the per-job `max_attempts` budget governs, not the schedule),
- DLQ entries derived from those jobs.

An operator who wants to also purge in-flight cron-fired work pauses the schedule and then bulk-cancels jobs filtered by `metadata.cron_name = <name>`. The two operations are intentionally separate because there is no canonical answer to "should already-running jobs be killed too?".

Cron pause and queue pause are also independent. Queue pause is enforced at dispatch, not enqueue: the atomic CTE inserts into a paused queue without complaint, and `last_enqueued_at` advances normally. With cron active + queue paused, fires accumulate as available jobs and dispatch on queue resume. With cron paused + queue active, no new fires arrive but in-flight work continues. Each surface is resumed independently. The `/cron` UI surfaces a "queue paused" badge so an operator looking at a quiet schedule sees the cause even when it is the consumer side that is stopped.

#### Model

The pause guarantee is verified in TLA+. `AwaCron` includes `Pause` and `Resume` actions; the `PausedBlocksEnqueue` property asserts that no step taken from a paused state increments `jobCount` and is checked across the full safety spec, including Pause / Resume storms. Liveness (`CoalescedLatestFireEventuallyEnqueued`, `CatchUpFiresEventuallyEnqueued`) is checked under a restricted "stable cluster, no adversarial pause" spec that includes `Resume` (with weak fairness) but omits `Pause` — TLC otherwise finds a Pause / Resume storm that starves `AtomicEnqueue` by toggling `paused` between the leader's read and CAS. This matches how the model already omits `Crash` / `Recover` from the liveness spec: progress claims hold only when the environment is not adversarial.

### Leader liveness verification

The advisory lock is session-scoped: as long as the connection is alive, the lock is held. But if the connection drops silently, Postgres releases the lock and another node becomes leader -- while the old node may still think it's leader. Awa verifies liveness by pinging the leader connection every 30 seconds (`SELECT 1`). If the ping fails, the node re-enters the election loop.

## Consequences

Migration v045 requires cron-before-storage lock ordering across the complete
pending range: released atomic enqueue locks cron before calling the storage
insert path. The Rust migrator drains cron first; external runners must do the
same. `AwaCronMigration` checks the two-party lock cycle, with a missing-drain
counterexample; SQL tests inspect the actual held locks and the released 0.6.7
rehearsal exercises live migration. See the upgrade guide for the evaluation pause.

### Positive

- **No external dependencies.** Schedules live in Postgres, evaluated by the existing leader. No systemd, no Kubernetes CronJob, no `pg_cron`.
- **Crash-safe.** The atomic CTE eliminates the mark-then-insert gap.
- **Multi-deployment safe.** Additive-only sync prevents accidental deletion of other deployments' schedules.
- **Timezone-aware.** Schedules support IANA timezones via `chrono-tz`, handling DST transitions correctly.
- **Eager validation.** Invalid cron expressions or timezones fail at builder time, not at fire time.
- **Pause without delete.** Operators can pause a noisy or misbehaving schedule and resume it later; `last_enqueued_at` and the schedule definition survive a pause/resume cycle. Re-deploying the schedule does not clear pause.

### Negative

- **1-second evaluation granularity.** Sub-second schedules are not supported. This is acceptable for cron-style workloads (hourly, daily, etc.).
- **Leader bottleneck.** All cron evaluation happens on the leader. For thousands of schedules this could become a bottleneck, though in practice most deployments have dozens, not thousands.
- **No automatic orphan cleanup.** Decommissioned schedules must be removed manually. This is an intentional trade-off for multi-deployment safety.
- **Coalesced by default.** If a schedule was down for 24 hours, only the most recent fire is recovered unless the schedule explicitly opts into `catch_up`.


## Owner-scoped reconciliation (#481)

Opt-in authoritative registration declares a complete manifest for one stable
owner; omitted configuration remains additive. Explicit authoritative empty is
valid. Names remain globally unique. New names are owned on first declaration;
existing names can be adopted/transferred only by an operator. Retirement is a durable tombstone, distinct from pause: restoring
sets the evaluation boundary to database time and does not replay retired time.

Every runtime publishes protocol capability and, when authoritative, a canonical
full-definition manifest independently of leadership. The reporter commits its
snapshot and declaration together. Database time controls freshness (at least
30 seconds or three snapshot intervals) and grace. All fresh database runtimes
must support the protocol. Zero declarations, mixed manifests, conflicts, and
retired desired names block automatic retirement. All live declarations' grace
requirements must be satisfied. A missed evidence window resets agreement.
New names may be inserted immediately; existing definitions synchronize only
with a single capable live manifest and no conflicts, without waiting for
retirement grace. This preserves stable definitions through mixed-revision
rollouts. A synchronized hash certifies active ownership of all desired names;
operator actions invalidate that certificate only for affected owners (both
sides of a transfer). Unsynchronized manifests check conflicts before agreement
is persisted, so heartbeat and leader passes cannot alternate the grace clock.

One transaction advisory lock serializes runtime snapshot writes (including old
binaries through a statement trigger), declaration publication, owner lifecycle
operations, and reconciliation. Owner rows additionally serialize owner state.
No job/lease heartbeat takes this lock. Publication checks agreement so a short
conflict between leader passes resets the durable grace clock. Reconciliation
rechecks under the same lock, then retires absent rows atomically. Lock order is
protocol lock before any row locks, with schedule rows ordered by name.
Read-only plans and previews use one repeatable-read snapshot without taking
the protocol lock; apply reevaluates under the serializer. The protocol is a
trusted-runtime coordination boundary, not authorization between SQL roles.

Retired schedule rows survive old UPSERT and reject physical deletion. The
BEFORE UPDATE fence suppresses the actual old atomic-enqueue UPDATE, so its
RETURNING relation is empty and no job is inserted. Owned definition updates
require the matching manager context; lifecycle changes require the operator
context. These transaction-local contexts are internal, not public SQL APIs.
Old manual-trigger clients must be retired before managing owned schedules;
manual trigger uses a read/insert path and is not the old automatic-enqueue
contract. Current manual trigger locks/rechecks retirement. Already accepted
jobs, retries, DLQ work, and user enqueues remain independent of schedule state.

No global pruning, automatic owner decommissioning, or physical tombstone purge
is provided. Explicit retire-owner works without live declarations. Re-registering
a retired name allows startup but stays inert and reports a plan conflict until
an explicit operator restoration. Restore-owner provides a bulk operation for
retired schedules after decommissioning. Foreign ownership still fails startup.
