# Public Surface Stability Policy

> **Status: Accepted** ([ADR-036](../adr/036-public-surface-stability-policy/index.md), from
> [0.7 roadmap](../0.7-roadmap/index.md) decision D6). This document is normative: release notes
> list breaking changes against its surface list, and changes to the promises below are made
> by amending this document in an ordinary reviewed PR.

Awa is consumed through several distinct surfaces. This document states, per surface, what is
covered by a compatibility promise, what is explicitly internal, and what each release type may
change. Anything not listed here is **internal** and may change in any release without notice.

## Release types (pre-1.0)

While Awa is pre-1.0, "minor" releases (0.6 → 0.7) play the semver-major role:

| Release type | May contain |
| --- | --- |
| **Patch** (0.7.0 → 0.7.1) | Bug fixes only. No breaking changes to any listed surface. No new migrations except to fix a defective migration. |
| **Minor** (0.7 → 0.8) | Breaking changes to listed surfaces are allowed **only** with: a changelog entry under "Breaking changes", a migration path in the upgrade guide, and — where feasible — a deprecation period per the policy below. |
| **Beta / RC** | Surfaces may change between pre-release tags of the same line (the 0.6 `QueueFanout` → `PartitionedQueue` rename is the precedent). Pre-release tags promise nothing to each other; the stable tag promises everything below. |

## Deprecation policy

Announce in release N (changelog + doc note), warn at runtime in N+1 where the surface makes a
runtime warning possible, remove in N+2. Security fixes may compress this schedule; the
changelog will say so explicitly.

## Surfaces

| Surface | What is covered | What is not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rust API** (`awa`, `awa-model`, `awa-macros`, `awa-testing`, `awa-seaorm`) | All `pub` items documented on docs.rs. Semver enforcement in CI is planned ([#402](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/402), `cargo-semver-checks`); until it lands, breaks are caught by review and the changelog rule below. | `#[doc(hidden)]` items; anything behind an unstable feature flag; `awa-worker`/`awa-ui` internals not re-exported by `awa`. |
| **Python API** (`awa-pg`) | Everything exported by `awa/__init__.py` and typed in the `.pyi` stubs (stub/API drift gated in CI per [#378](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/378)). Async and `_sync` counterparts per ADR-009. | Underscore-prefixed members; the raw PyO3 module layout. |
| **SQL producer contract** | The currently shipped `awa.insert_job_compat(...)` contract: signature, semantics, BLAKE3 `unique_key` derivation, and `ordering_key` shard hash, versioned against `awa.schema_version`. It remains covered until [#342](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/342) ships `awa.insert_job(...)` with its contract artifacts and completes the documented migration/deprecation step. | Other internal functions and direct DML against storage tables. The physical implementation behind the compatibility entry point may change without changing its covered contract. |
| **Terminal read surface** | `{schema}.terminal_jobs` (per ADR-026) and the documented public views. | `done_entries` physical layout and all segment/ring/ledger internals — compact batches mean not every completed job is physically a `done_entries` row. |
| **HTTP admin API** | The documented endpoints and their response types (a typed, non-DAL response module in `awa-ui` — [#403](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/403); schemas listed in `ui-design.md`). The worker probe bodies (`/healthz`, `/readyz` field names, per `deployment.md`). A standalone `awa-api` crate is deferred until a second consumer exists ([#143](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/143), expected with the MCP server). | Handler internals; the embedded UI's asset paths; any endpoint not documented in `ui-design.md`. |
| **Callback receiver contract** | The signed callback endpoints (ADR-018/021/027): paths under the configured prefix, signature scheme, payload shapes, error mapping. Identical between embedded router and `awa callbacks serve`. | — |
| **CLI** | Documented commands, their exit codes, and `--json` output schemas (today: `awa health`, `awa queue overrides show`, `awa storage status`; `awa doctor` when it ships). Fatal errors render their `Display` guidance. | Human-readable (non-`--json`) output formatting. |
| **Metrics** | Metric names, types, and attribute keys listed in the telemetry docs. | Attribute *values* cardinality; bucket boundaries (may be tuned in minors with a changelog note). |
| **Storage schema / migrations** | The migration *path*: `awa migrate` upgrades any supported prior version's schema (support window per [#367](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/367) and ADR-037's gate). | Schema contents. Tables, indexes, functions, and triggers are internal; migrations may reshape them freely. There is no downgrade path. |
| **Configuration** | Documented `QueueConfig`/builder options, Python `start()` kwargs, and `AWA_*` environment variables in `configuration.md`. | Undocumented env vars; internal tuning defaults (may change in minors with a changelog note). |

### Accepted designs that are not active surfaces

The table above lists shipped contracts. Accepting an ADR does not add a public surface before its
implementation, documentation, conformance evidence, and release note land together:

- [#342](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/342) and ADR-043 reserve `awa.insert_job(...)` as the
  future clean, single-signature SQL producer capability. Its final
  `opts jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb` argument is the sole extension point, and PostgreSQL computes the
  ADR-033 concurrency digest and shard authoritatively from logical keys. Until it ships,
  `insert_job_compat` remains the covered transitional producer entry point rather than becoming
  internal by documentation alone.
- [ADR-042](../adr/042-caller-owned-finalization-transactions/index.md) reserves
  `<queue_storage_schema>.complete_job(...)` and its receipt/error/version semantics for
  caller-owned finalization. The function is not shipped and is not yet an active SQL worker
  surface.
- [ADR-033](../adr/033-per-key-execution-control/index.md) adds the future domain-separated SHA-256
  `concurrency_key` digest and ordering/concurrency shard-precedence vectors to #342's contract
  gate; those promises become active only with the implementing release. The digest algorithm
  differs from `unique_key`'s client-side BLAKE3 (ADR-002) by design — PostgreSQL computes the
  concurrency digest authoritatively and has no native BLAKE3.

The implementation PR for each surface must add or replace the corresponding table row, ship the
referenced conformance artifacts, and record any transition from an older covered entry point in
the changelog and upgrade guide.

**Reserved metadata namespace.** Job `metadata` keys prefixed `awa:` are
reserved for awa itself (today: `awa:traceparent`,
[ADR-039](../adr/039-trace-propagation/index.md)). A caller-supplied value under a
documented reserved key is honored as authoritative, but awa may add,
interpret, or stop writing reserved keys in any release. Keys without the
prefix are user-owned and pass through untouched.

## What "supported" means for binary/schema skew

Rolling deploys create windows where an older binary runs against a newer schema. The support
statement, asserted nightly by `scripts/compat-matrix.sh` against **pinned release
artifacts** ([#367](https://github.com/hardbyte/awa/issues/367)):

- **One minor behind (0.6.2 binary, 0.7 schema in `columns` authority):** full
  lifecycle supported — enqueue, claim, complete, cancel — on a finalized cluster.
  0.6.2 is the required stepping-stone and recognizes this exact forward-compatible
  schema shape. The pinned `awa-pg==0.6.0` wheel remains a data-plane regression leg,
  but 0.6.0/0.6.1 must never invoke `awa migrate` on a 0.7 schema. After the one-way
  ring-authority flip, pre-ledger binaries are deliberately fenced and unsupported.
- **Two minors behind (0.5.x binary, finalized schema):** asymmetric. *Producers* keep
  working — the `awa.jobs` compatibility routing sends their inserts to the active engine.
  *Workers* are inert: they claim from the canonical hot table, which is empty on a
  finalized cluster. Upgrade workers before or with the finalize step.
- **Newer binary, older unfinalized schema:** `awa migrate` refuses loudly (exit non-zero,
  message names the exact finalize steps) rather than upgrading over live canonical work —
  the [ADR-037](../adr/037-canonical-engine-deprecation/index.md) gate. Asserted against a 0.5.7-era
  schema carrying a canonical job; the pre-migrate-0.6 variant of this leg activates
  automatically once the 0.7 line ships its first migration.
- The 0.7 boundary additionally requires a finalized queue-storage transition (ADR-037).

## Relationship to release notes

Every stable release's changelog lists breaking changes against this document's surface list.
If a change breaks something *not* listed here, it is not a breaking change — but if that
surprises users repeatedly, the fix is to amend this document, not to argue.


### Periodic ownership (v045)

The opt-in owner protocol leaves unowned additive registration unchanged. Its
mixed-version guarantee covers the released 0.6.7 automatic cron enqueue and
additive UPSERT paths on the expanded schema, tested by
`scripts/rehearse-cron-ownership.sh`. Fresh legacy runtimes block automatic
retirement. Owned-schedule operator actions require current CLI/API clients;
legacy manual-trigger clients are not covered by the retirement guarantee.
The protocol does not change already-enqueued job or retry semantics. The
existing ring-authority fence and schema migration fail-safe remain independent.
